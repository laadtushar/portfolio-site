  <div><p>I won't lie; I am incredibly jealous of all my classmates who are enjoying their lives, partying, or taking trips &amp; vacations. Those Instagram stories that pop up every day are frustrating. </p><p>What did I do not to deserve that fun? Am I losing my prime years to work? Why can't I go out clubbing every day? These questions cloud my mind at the end of a productive day at work. I have talked to a few trusted people about this, and they all agree that I should have a life. I am 20, and I am overworking. But I dismiss them by saying, <em>"It's my hustle to do, and it will all be worth it one day."</em></p><p><em>"It will all be worth it one day" </em>that's what I keep telling myself, but I would be lying if I said I believe in that shit. I don't know the future; maybe I will regret not enjoying my early 20s; maybe at the end of the day we all will be standing on the same boat, and I wouldn't have achieved anything extra. </p><p>In order to understand why I have a 16-hour work life, Let me give you a quick insight into a day in my life. I wake up at 6:15 AM, get ready, and reach college by 7:15 AM. I sign into the office (remote work) at 7:30 AM and work until my first lecture; after that, I keep switching between work and college until 6:30 PM, after which I leave for home and reach by 7:00 PM. I haven't signed out of the office yet because I still have a lot of work and have not completed my daily working hours. So I work until 8:30 or 9:00 PM, after which I have dinner. Before I sleep, I finish some work for clients I have taken up in my startup (Build My Site). After this, I go to bed by 10:30 PM. The last thing I do at night is, scroll some reels on Instagram, listen to some songs and feel sad about my pathetic social life. </p><p>You would ask what keeps me going and what's stopping me from giving up on everything and just sleeping for a week at least.</p><p>Let me tell you a story; I choose weekends to fix my sleep schedule by continuously sleeping for 16-18 hours. The other weekend I was asleep for the last 12 hours during the day, and I was about to wake up when I heard my father ask my mother, "Why is he sleeping during the day?" My mother said, "Let him sleep; he works hard the whole week." There's your answer. My mom knows I work hard, and that's all I need to keep going. </p><p>My mother is the earning member of the family - I have seen her take up enormous responsibilities that any Indian woman needs to take up while also earning for the whole family and getting food on the table. I am probably just trying to be like her, and maybe one day, I will be able to give her the life of comfort that she has always ensured for me. </p><p>So apart from the fact that I was bullied my whole childhood and I have a pathological need to prove to others that I am better than them and that you can't bully me anymore, It's the urge to make my mother proud that helps me keep the hustle up.</p><p><br></p></div>
