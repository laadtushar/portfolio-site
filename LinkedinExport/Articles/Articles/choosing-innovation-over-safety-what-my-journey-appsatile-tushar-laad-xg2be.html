  <div><p>Growing up in India, I was raised with a very familiar message: play it safe. Study hard, get more degrees, secure a stable job in a reputable company, and build a predictable life. In many families—including mine—success was defined by safety, not by experimentation. The idea of taking risks, betting on uncertain ideas, or joining a young startup was often seen as unnecessary “adventure”.</p><p>But from very early on, I felt pulled in a different direction.</p><p>I’ve always been fascinated by innovation, by solving problems no one has solved before, by building something that doesn’t exist yet. Not because it guaranteed money or success—most innovative startups fail—but because of the thrill of research, creation, and genuine impact. That curiosity eventually led me to Appsatile, and it has shaped how I view work, technology, and India’s evolving tech culture.</p><h3>What I Observed in India’s Tech Landscape</h3><p>Many of India’s largest and most respected tech companies—TCS, Infosys, Wipro—are powerhouses in the service industry. They execute brilliantly, they scale reliably, and they deliver global value. But they are service-based at their core. They optimise more than they invent.</p><p>Meanwhile, in the US, the giants—Google, Apple, NVIDIA, Tesla—built their empires through heavy investment in research, bold risks, and a culture where failure is seen as part of the process, not something to fear.</p><p>India is changing, of course. A newer wave of startups like Ather, Zomato, Lenskart, Zepto, and Skyroot are proving that innovation is possible here—and not just possible but scalable. But culturally, many young people are still encouraged to follow the safest path, not the most creative one.</p><p>And I don’t say this to criticise. I say it because I lived it.</p><h3>When Playing It Safe Feels Like the Only Option</h3><p>In my family, and in many middle-class families, the priority was stability. Pursue qualifications that guarantee employability. Choose known paths. Don’t take risks that could “set you back”.</p><p>That mindset comes from a place of protection, not limitation—but it can also suppress a generation’s potential for innovation.</p><p>Because innovation is not safe. Research is not predictable. And progress cannot be built by repeating what’s already been done.</p><h3>What Appsatile Changed For Me</h3><p>Joining Appsatile has been the opposite of everything I was taught. It’s raw, messy, experimental, unpredictable—and exactly the environment where deep learning happens. Nothing is handed to you. You build, you break, you rebuild, you rethink. You question assumptions. You push boundaries.</p><p>It’s not about salaries or titles. It’s about solving real problems. It’s about creating tools that didn’t exist last week. It’s about transforming ideas into systems, even if they fail the first five times.</p><p>And that’s the part of Indian tech culture I want to see more of.</p><h3>Why India Needs More Research, More Risk-Takers, More Builders</h3><p>India has brilliant minds. We have world-class engineers. We have ambition. What we often lack is the encouragement to take risks early, to explore research roles, to innovate without being punished for failure.</p><p>If we want to see Indian tech produce the next global product giants—not just service giants—then we have to shift our mindset:</p><ul><li><p>Encourage young people to experiment</p></li><li><p>Normalise failure as part of learning</p></li><li><p>Invest more in R&amp;D, not just execution</p></li><li><p>Support early-stage startups doing deep tech</p></li><li><p>Celebrate problem-solving, not just job security</p></li></ul><p>The real value for the next generation lies in innovation, not in playing safe.</p><h3>My Message to Anyone Who Feels the Same</h3><p>If you feel drawn to building, exploring, and solving impossible problems—follow it. Even if it breaks tradition. Even if people don’t understand. Even if the path feels uncertain.</p><p>Because the world doesn’t change through safety.</p><p>It changes because someone chooses to take a risk.</p><p>And I’m glad I chose that path—even when everything around me said not to.</p></div>
