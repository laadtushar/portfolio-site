        "Hats off to Tushar. He is quite young (as far age is concerned). There are two reasons why you should be hiring him: Non-technical side: He is as committed as one can be. Deadlines, responsibilities, commitment on deliveries: he would do a realistic job of it and deliver. Technical side: his resume speaks for itself. he started as a website developer (wordpress), took on data engineer role, built APIs for us (with team leader involved). He performed beautifully. Followed best practices of coding, used Github Co-pilot, conducted trainings for his team members. Enforced good documentation practices. I am sure there is more he has done. Srujan Patil from our team will be able to share more. He has worked with him a lot as well. For some part, he was reporting to Srujan directly. To summarize, Tushar has the inherent interest, curiosity to solve problems, do good for the company. I would like to share the incident when we assigned him first labeling/machine learning project. He came back not only with solution but alternative approaches, pros and cons and all documented well. Please do not hire him because we would like to hire him back when he graduates. Just kidding, folks.",

He has excellent skills at building Data Pipelines, REST APIs, and Docker. He is always eager to learn new tools and frameworks and has a knack at experimenting. Tushar is also a great team player who communicates effectively and shares knowledge generously. I highly recommend Tushar, as he would be a valuable asset to any organization.",

He is also Extremely proficient in web development. He is a very quick learner and has gained a lot of experience in database management over the last year ranging from CRUD operations on the database to advanced SP creations. His job profile has also ensured his proficiency in integrating python based programs with SQL databases. He has also gained experience in API development and deployment using Docker over the last couple of months. He is very cooperative and easy to work with. Very proactive in taking up problems and coming up with novel solutions for them. Extremely hardworking with an exceptional work ethic.",

        "Having had the pleasure of working with Tushar, I can attest to his exceptional work ethic, collaborative spirit, and outstanding performance. His commitment to excellence is evident in the meticulous attention to detail and unwavering determination he brings to every task. What truly sets Tushar apart is his exceptional teamwork and interpersonal skills. Tushar is a unifying presence in our team, always ready to lend a hand, share knowledge, and support their colleagues. Their collaborative approach fosters a productive and positive work environment, making him an invaluable member of our team. One standout moment that exemplifies Tushar's technical acumen and innovative thinking occurred during a critical phase of our chat system project. We were faced with the complex challenge of implementing end-to-end encryption, particularly how to securely store and manage encryption keys. He devised an elegant solution that balanced security with usability: storing public keys on our servers while keeping private keys on users' local devices. This approach not only fortified our system's security but also introduced an additional layer of protection, requiring users to authenticate with their private keys upon logging in from any device. Tushar's strategic thinking and technical expertise were instrumental in overcoming this hurdle, significantly enhancing our project's security architecture. His openness to feedback and constructive dialogue has not only contributed to their personal growth but has also inspired our team to strive for continuous improvement.",

I am a fullstack dev who collaborates with designers to build their wildest dreams.  Together, let's create something that stands out–and has your users saying, "woah."

I've been working as a creative technologist for 7 years, helping best-in-class designers build award winning projects–including 4 STA100's, a TDC and a Webby.

I separate myself from the pack in two ways:

1. I specialize in building projects with particularly challenging designs, special effects, interactivity, & multimedia.  This skillset lends itself well to creating eye-catching marketing experiences, microsites, artistic galleries/exhibitions, and so on.  I love playful, bold, provocative brands, but I also have experience building more conservative, standard marketing projects–especially if it serves a cause I believe in.  I will take a designer's challenging, exciting idea and make it happen with precision–and often collaborate with them to figure out how to take their ideas even further.

2.  I see the big picture and take ownership/pride in my work.  Leading up, down and laterally, I will wear multiple hats to facilitate successful launches.  While I'm comfortable staying in my lane and moving tickets, I tend to find myself in environments where I add additional value to project management, strategy, and design.  This can look like:
- Early involvement as a consultant in ideation phase to derisk, force multiply, and generally maximize the lift/impact ratio of the build
- Collaborate with designers early to build prototypes and explore an idea collaboratively
- Helping discover a minimum viable product given business goals, and helping design a team workflow/timeline/milestones
- Coaching designers on best practices
- Filling in gaps with minimal oversight, if desired.
- I'm the sort of dev who notices inconsistent capitalization in the copy.


When I'm not building cool tech, I'm playing funk trombone.  I have toured the country with world class acts including The Isley Brothers and I've headlined Chicago comedy clubs with my electric trombone storytelling shows.
