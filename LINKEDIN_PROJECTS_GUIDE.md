## Project 1: NLP and LLM Driven Job Matching Platform

**Title:** NLP and LLM Driven Identification of Job Intent, Technologies, and Teams

**Duration:** Apr 2023 - Present

**Associated with:** Newcastle University

**Description:**
The process of matching job seekers with suitable job opportunities is a critical task in the recruitment industry. However, the complexity and variability of job descriptions often pose challenges in accurately identifying the job intent, required technologies, and team structures.

This research project aims to develop an NLP and LLM based platform that can analyze job descriptions and extract relevant information, thereby enhancing the job matching process. By leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and Large Language Models (LLMs), the proposed platform enables a more semantic understanding of job descriptions and candidate profiles. 

**Key Objectives:**
- Scraping and preprocessing job descriptions
- Generating a comprehensive dictionary of job intents, technologies, and teams
- Labeling job descriptions using the generated dictionary and NLP techniques
- Evaluating and comparing the performance of various NLP and LLM models
- Developing an ETL pipeline for data processing
- Implementing a prototype API for ingesting job descriptions and retrieving job opportunities

**Technologies:** NLP, LLM, Python, ETL, API Development, Data Mining
