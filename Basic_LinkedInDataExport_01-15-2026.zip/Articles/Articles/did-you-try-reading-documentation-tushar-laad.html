  <div><p><em>"Did you try reading the documentation?"</em></p><p>This is a question I've lately posed to many folks who have come to me with coding problems. When starting to code something new, it can be tempting to dive right in and start writing code without taking the time to read the documentation. </p><p>Now I am no saint. I added FastAPI to my tech stack last week. Initially, I gave in to the temptation of taking parts of code from random medium articles and trying to transform them into a solution to my problem. After spending 2 hours on millions of errors, I took out time to find the right documentation and read it to the letter. I was ready with an API in no time. I learned four important lessons from my experience:</p><div><hr></div><h3>Saves Time</h3><p>Reviewing the documentation before beginning to code can save you a significant amount of time in the long run. Documentation may help you avoid common mistakes and pitfalls by providing clear knowledge of utilizing a certain library or framework. This can help you get up to speed faster and start creating code straight away.</p><h3>Fewer Errors; More Results</h3><p>As you go through the documentation, you will not only get clear guidelines for producing error-free code, but you will also receive troubleshooting tips and examples of frequent problems, which will help you handle errors as they arise.</p><h3>Better Understanding &amp; Optimization</h3><p>Documentation definitely gives you a better understanding of what the code is doing behind your back; this allows you to make more informed decisions when writing code and can help you optimize it for better performance. Furthermore, understanding the underlying principles of a library or framework might assist you in customizing the code to meet your needs.</p><h3>Easier To Collaborate</h3><p>While committing or documenting your code, you can simply attach the documentation link; This can help ensure that everyone on the team is on the same page and that code is written consistently.</p><div><hr></div><p>All in all, By taking the time to read the documentation, you can ensure that you are writing high-quality code that is efficient, effective, and easy to maintain. Therefore, it is highly recommended that developers prioritize reviewing the documentation before beginning to code.</p></div>
