Suleiman,Muhammad Sabo,Newcastle University,Student Ambassador,"Having had the pleasure of working with Tushar, I can attest to his exceptional work ethic, collaborative spirit, and outstanding performance. His commitment to excellence is evident in the meticulous attention to detail and unwavering determination he brings to every task. What truly sets Tushar apart is his exceptional teamwork and interpersonal skills. Tushar is a unifying presence in our team, always ready to lend a hand, share knowledge, and support their colleagues. Their collaborative approach fosters a productive and positive work environment, making him an invaluable member of our team.  One standout moment that exemplifies Tushar’s technical acumen and innovative thinking occurred during a critical phase of our chat system project. We were faced with the complex challenge of implementing end-to-end encryption, particularly how to securely store and manage encryption keys. He devised an elegant solution that balanced security with usability: storing public keys on our servers while keeping private keys on users' local devices. This approach not only fortified our system's security but also introduced an additional layer of protection, requiring users to authenticate with their private keys upon logging in from any device. Tushar’s strategic thinking and technical expertise were instrumental in overcoming this hurdle, significantly enhancing our project's security architecture. His openness to feedback and constructive dialogue has not only contributed to their personal growth but has also inspired our team to strive for continuous improvement.","03/30/24, 11:00 AM",HIDDEN

Vinay,"Mehendi, PhD",OceanFrogs Software,CEO- Chief Frog,"Hats off to Tushar. He is quite young (as far age is concerned). There are two reasons why you should be hiring him:  Non-technical side: He is as committed as one can be. Deadlines, responsibilities, commitment on deliveries: he would do a realistic job of it and deliver.   Technical side: his resume speaks for itself. he started as a website developer (wordpress), took on data engineer role, built APIs for us (with team leader involved). He performed beautifully. Followed best practices of coding, used Github Co-pilot, conducted trainings for his team members. Enforced good documentation practices.   I am sure there is more he has done. Srujan Patil from our team will be able to share more. He has worked with him a lot as well. For some part, he was reporting to Srujan directly.  To summarize, Tushar has the inherent interest, curiosity to solve problems, do good for the company.  I would like to share the incident when we assigned him first labeling/machine learning project. He came back not only with solution but alternative approaches, pros and cons and all documented well.  Please do not hire him because we would like to hire him back when he graduates. Just kidding, folks.  thanks, Vinay","09/20/23, 03:10 PM",VISIBLE
